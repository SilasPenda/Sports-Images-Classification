# Sports-Images-Classification
This is an image classification project to classify sports images to be one of 100 trained sports classes. I created a streamlit web app to test the model.

# Guide
* Import necessary libraries
* Read train, validation and test image directories and save images path in a list
* Generate new images using ImageDataGenerator
* Load pretrained model and freeze the layers
* Create layers
* Train model
* Test model and save as '.h5' model
* Create web app using streamlit
